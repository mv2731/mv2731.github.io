# About Me

I'm Maya Venkatraman, a Research Software Engineer at the [AlQuraishi Laboratory](https://www.aqlab.io/). 

In the past, I worked at Google Research, applying computer vision to dermatologic image classification ([Derm on Lens](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saibala/2023/06/16/you-can-now-use-google-lens-on-your-phone-to-look-up-skin-conditions/)). I also contributed on a 20% basis to genomics projects, including [DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) and [DeepNull](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27930-0).

Before that, I worked at YouTube Trust and Safety, building infrastructure for ML-based spam detection.

# Interests

Sex-mediated differences in disease pathogenesis -- how do Xi and Y differentially affect genomic regulation on autosomal chromosomes? How does this explain some of the sex-biases we observe in disease?

Diverse representation in genomic datasets. We can increase the power of statistical tests of association by increasing sample size, and we open up many opportunities for discovery by ensuring genetic diversity within and across populations. Expanding diversity in genomic datasets not only enhances generalizability of findings but also enables the identification of population-specific variants, improving our ability to understand disease mechanisms and develop equitable precision medicine approaches. 

Developing selective learning methods to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of training models for genome-related prediction tasks.

# Favorite Books

* Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones -- significantly better, though far less famous than the movie, with a much more coherent plot. 
* Invisible Women -- the chapter on disparities in the medical system profoundly reshaped my understanding of the research and funding landscape in the United States, illuminating systemic biases present at nearly every stage of biomedical discovery.
* This is How You Lose Her by Junot Diaz -- a heart-rending last chapter that captures some of the most profound sentiments shared by humankind.
